# Laravel + React JSX Starter Kit

## Introduction

Our React JSX starter kit provides a robust, modern starting point for building Laravel applications with a React frontend using [Inertia](https://inertiajs.com), using **JavaScript/JSX instead of TypeScript** for broader accessibility.

Inertia allows you to build modern, single-page React applications using classic server-side routing and controllers. This lets you enjoy the frontend power of React combined with the incredible backend productivity of Laravel and lightning-fast Vite compilation.

This React starter kit utilizes React 19, **JavaScript/JSX**, Tailwind, and the [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) and [radix-ui](https://www.radix-ui.com) component libraries.

## Usage

```bash
laravel new my-app --using=aliziodev/react-jsx-starter-kit
```
